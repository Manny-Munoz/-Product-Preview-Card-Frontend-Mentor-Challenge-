### What I Learned

I learned that if a hover it's needed to add, it can be add a media query `hover` to make sure that it will only be shown if and only the device where it is displaying does have a mouse.
```css
@media (hover:hover){
  .card__button:hover{
    filter: brightness(75%)
  }
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Hover media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/hover) - This helps me to understand the hover media query feature
